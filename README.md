# Todo-App

It is a task management app, developed in React Native by using the builtin components of React Native.

# Description:

- Here in this todo app, I developed the android app.
- In this I learnt about basic development in React Native.
- I came to know about styling units in React native ( that we donot use any unit in React Native).
- Styling techniques for the React Native Components are learnt too.
- I tried my best to use better naming conventions in it, I mostly used "Camel Case" for the styling Classes.
- To add or delete a Task, I utilized Hooks, Spread operators of Lists, etc.
- For functional rerendering, UseEffect is used, in which the task list is used in the dependency array, which means the component will rerender when task list is updated.

# Running the App:

Following Scripts will be used to run the Todo-App:

- Open the terminal, at the root folder of the Project.
- To start the metro bundler, you should write "npx react-native start". It will start the basic metro bundler.
- To run the app on Emulator, at first start the Emulator Device from the Android Studio, and then run the command "npx react-native run-android"
- To run it on the IOS, you need the IOS Emulator, and run the command "npx react-native run-ios"
